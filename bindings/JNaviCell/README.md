# JNaviCell

[NaviCell](https://navicell.curie.fr) is a web tool for exploring large biological molecular interactions maps.

[NaviCell Web Service](https://navicell.curie.fr/pages/nav_web_service.html) for
Network-based Data Visualization allows mapping high-throughput data (mRNA,
microRNA and protein expressions, gene copy number and mutation profiles,
simple gene lists and clinical data) onto NaviCell network maps. We have
developped a REST-like API  to automate the process and allow people to create
and play with graphical representations, and we are developping bindings to
different popular languages (currently Python, R and Java).

JNaviCell is the Java implementation to access the NaviCell web service.
